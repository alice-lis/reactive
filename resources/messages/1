To-one Relationships

To trigger notifications automatically for a to-one relationship you should either override keyPathsForValuesAffectingValueForKey: or implement a suitable method that follows the pattern it defines for registering dependent keys.

For example, the full name of a person is dependent on both the first and last names. A method that returns the full name could be written as follows:

- (NSString *)fullName {
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ %@",firstName, lastName];
}
An application observing the fullName property must be notified when either the firstName or lastName properties change, as they affect the value of the property.

One solution is to override keyPathsForValuesAffectingValueForKey: specifying that the fullName property of a person is dependent on the lastName and firstName properties. Listing 1 shows an example implementation of such a dependency:
